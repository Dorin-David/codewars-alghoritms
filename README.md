# Welcome in the Algorithm repository.

Here I store some algorithms I had fun solving; especially those that taught me new things. Most of the problems in this repository come from *Codewars*, where they are called *katas*. Codewars has a nice system for classifying its katas: the difficulty of each problem (called *kyu*) goes from 8 (the easiest) to 1 (the hardest). Each file-name on this repository starts with the number that stands for the difficulty of the kata (for example: [6kyu]Fibonacci sequence), followed by its original name. However, when it comes to ranks please note that **the difficulty of each kata is voted by other users on codewars** and is, therefore, **subjective** and it can vary tremendously; an old kata may be easier than a newer, for example, even though the first is rated higher. **So don't judge a problem by its ranking**. Having a rank is useful for figuring out the possible difficulty of the problem, but just that. What matters is how much a problem helped in trying out new strategies, thinking outside the box andlearning something new about this amazing language which is JavaScript. 

What will you find in each file: 

1. A link to the challenge.
1. A description of the problem (usually the original description written by the author of the kata; I may add or change something to it if I feel the description 
   is not clear) with a short example of the input/output.
1. The code I come up with as a solution. All of them. If I come back to a solution I'm not happy with, and write it more efficiently, I'll update the file. This way I'll be able 
   to keep track of my progress through the months... 
1. If I feel a solution is not clear, I'll comment it. I may include a solution written by another user on codewars; I'll comment that too. I will highlight the chunks of code 
   I don't understand. If you find a snippet of code that I don't understand (I will mark them with ?!) please feel free to pull a request and comment it. 
   If you do so, please write your nickname, so we can see who contributed.
1. Finally, a brief 'what did i learn'. It consists notes about what I learned through solving the problem. I may include links to documentation, online courses and so on. I'd
   like to share whit everyone what helped me grow.

Notes

I know that most of the solutions here probably do not look very readable. That's indeed an issue, in a real world scenario. A solution that would get an A for efficiency may easily get an F for readability. I've been practicing a lot on codewars. The short style of writing used by most users has influenced me, and I've adopted it. What I worry about is, in the first place, finding a solution that works. We must consider the environment where code is written, and for this particular one a certain style works. I think a solution can be understood even if it uses a ternary operator instead of an if/else if; the callback passed to a higher-order function can use arrow notation and have its parameters shorten; after you start using them every day there is not point in keep writing the parameters to reduce/map/forEach, for instance, as 'accumulator', 'currentElement', 'arrayTraversed' ecc; a short a|b is enough. 
As I said I will comment most of my solutions anyway, so don't worry if a code looks a bit cryptic at a first glance... 

Enough for now. This is a work in progress, I'll soon add more informations.... Again, any contribution is welcomed...
